# reactFCCTwitchAPI

This is my first portfolio website

## About

[**Demo**](https://www.dmukhovskyy.com/)

It's a responsive landing page with different sections.
Includes some animations and it's build mainly around material design.

## Tech

I've used jQuery, SASS, HTML5 and a framework called MaterializeCSS to build this website.
All parts/sections are single components with their own SASS/JS files.

MaterializeCSS is the main deal here for the UI - [link](http://materializecss.com/)

That cool text effect at the beginning is based on a TextScramble by Justin Windle - [link](https://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/mErPAK)

Floating particles are particles.js by Vincent Garreau - [link](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)

Finally the page is hosted on Google App Engine instance running python, you can find the app.yaml config file in the root of the project, and here is a repo for a simple Google App Engine wrapper running python [link](https://github.com/maxdyy/appEngineDevWrapper)
